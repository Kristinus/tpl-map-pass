# tpl-map-pass

# Objective
Every summer in Toronto, they do a city wide distribution of Museum + Arts Pass provided by the Toronto Public Library. I want to determine which libraries provide the most amount of passes. I also want to determine which library I can go to if I want a particular pass.

## What I learned
I initially thought I can get all attractions at once when lining up to get a pass in the library. Instead, I learned that I can only choose one attraction and would not be possible to get other attractions on the same day.
Because it takes around 1 hour to line up (depending when you start lining up and which library) I figure it is no longer worth it to continue this updating repository.
